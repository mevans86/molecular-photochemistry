# Molecular Photochemistry
Well into my graduate studies, I was mystified by molecular excited states. One day, I decided I would try to fix that. This course is the result! The course is primarily based on [*Modern Molecular Photochemistry*](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Molecular-Photochemistry-Organic-Molecules/dp/1891389254/ref=sr_1_1) by Turro and [*Photochemistry of Organic Compounds: From Concepts to Practice*](https://www.amazon.com/Photochemistry-Organic-Compounds-Concepts-Practice/dp/1405161736/ref=sr_1_1) by Kl√°n and Wirz.

Lecture videos for the course are available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLykBd3LSjfsRZpE8tgC6yILAsT16CsFeu).
